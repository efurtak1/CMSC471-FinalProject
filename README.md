Additionally, some more detail regarding the project is that:
1. We all met up for a brainstorming session once the project was out and viewable.
2. Initially, we had thought about about making 3 visualizatoins, but after some further thought, we decided to go with 2 exceptional ones. This is also why we decided to do a heatmap with various extra characteristics and a bubble plot that was inspired by Tableau's interactive bubble graph. Next, we drew up a draft of what we wanted the webpage to include and what colors we would use (decided to go with red to depict the "deathliness" of the dataset).
3. We split up the work such that there were two main people responsible for each visualization and one that would be a supporter everywhere. Elizabeth was responsible for the heat map visualization, William was responsible for the bubble plot, and Peyton helped out everywhere and made the back-up demo video.
4. The heat map was based on a CMSC471 Lab done with a similar approach. The bubble plot was created with the help of an Observable example and ChatGPT.
5. The dataset itself comes from the data.gov website: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-leading-causes-of-death-united-states
6. Overall, we were all very happy with our results and had a great team dynamic going!
