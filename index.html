        <p>This webpage features an interactive visualization of deaths in the U.S., displaying trends by cause and
             geographic region. The main view includes a heatmap that highlights mortality rates across states, allowing 
             users to explore variations over time using a year slider. Additionally, an interactive graph with bouncing 
             balls represents different causes of death, where each ball's movement and size correspond 
            to mortality data. Users can filter by year, cause, and region to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset.</p>

        <h2> Mortality Trends Over Time Geographically</h2>
        <p>This visualization shows how mortality rates have changed across the United States. The goal of this visualization 
            is to detect if any particular illness is more prevalent in certain geographical areas or in certain years. First, we implemented a dropdown and slider
            to filter data across cause of death and year. We also employed a red color gradient to differentiate the number of deaths in each state. Lastly, we added a mouseover feature 
            to showcase more specific details such as death rate per state. To utilize this visualization, begin by choosing a cause of death from the dropdown as well as a year, and begin
            observing.

        <h2>Interactive Mortality Trends Over Time</h2>
        <p>This visualization displays mortality amount through a packed bubble plot. The goal of this visualization is to reveal the leading causes of death in total, without the lens 
            of geography. The packed bubble plot separates each cause of death into an individual bubble with the size correlating to the number of deaths.
            Similar to the geographical visualization, there is the ability to filter the data by year with the slider and hovering on a bubble showcases more detail. Another exciting feature this visualization supports is
            the ability to move the bubbles around. Just move the bubbles around and watch them come back.

        <p>
            This group project was an engaging and collaborative effort that required significant dedication. 
            It began with an initial brainstorming session where we selected our two main data 
            visualizations: a geographical heatmap and an interactive bubble plot (inspired by Tableau’s Bubble Plot). 
            Elizabeth led the development of the geographical visualization, including the slider and legend, with 
            occasional assistance from Peyton.
             Meanwhile, William implemented the bubble plot with Elizabeth’s support, along with its slider and legend.
